<p><strong>JUDGING RING –Dairy cattle, described by judges as the best
shows at the Western Washington Fair at Puyallup since the war, circle
the judging ring before appraising eyes of spectators. Quality of stock
this year is so high officials of Carnation Milk Farms, one of the
biggest entrants, readily admit “stiff competition” from entrants from
other herds. (Post-Intelligencer Photo)</strong></p>
