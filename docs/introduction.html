        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Diary of a City Bred Farmer on Puget Sound</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h3>
<p>When my dad, Clarence Dirks, began his <em><strong>Diary of a City
Bred Farmer on Puget Sound</strong></em> column in Seattle’s
<em>Post-Intelligencer (PI)</em> morning newspaper in May 1946, he was
already well known to his readers. At least to those with any interest
in the local sports scene. As a University of Washington athlete, he was
a member of the 1925 football squad that outscored its opponents 480 to
59 in the regular season and came close to an unofficial national title
before losing to Alabama 19-20 in the 1926 Rose Bowl. He had a standout
season in 1927 and went on to captain the 1928 Husky eleven. A month
after the end of the football season he began his career as by-lined
sports writer for the <em>PI.</em> He continued as a <em>PI</em> sports
writer until World War 2 intervened and he traded his typewriter for a
shipyard caulking mallet in November 1942. During the 1930s he also
penned a dozen sports-related articles for national publications
including <em>Dime Sports, Esquire</em> and <em>The Saturday Evening
Post.</em> So, Clarence Dirks was not an unknown quantity when his
<em>City Bred Farmer</em> column greeted morning <em>PI</em> readers for
the first time, beginning on page one of the May 7, 1946 edition and
continuing in over 1200 editions of Seattle’s morning paper.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1930, his second year at the <em>PI,</em> 27
year-old Clarence Dirks met 18 year-old intern Cleo Coons an aspiring
writer who had just completed year freshman year at the UW majoring in
journalism. The couple dated during her sophomore year and married in
the summer of 1931. They spent their honeymoon in a tiny cabin at a fish
camp at Indian Beach on Camano Island, some 60 miles north of Seattle.
Shortly afterward the owners of the fish camp decided to sell off their
cabins and Clarence and Cleo Dirks purchased one and spent as many
weekends on Camano as they could, especially after their son Marty was
born in 1934. Magazine sales provided the Dirks household enough money
to build a larger cabin on their Camano property. Towards the end of
World War 2 Clarence Dirks had enough money put by to retire from paid
employment temporarily. The family moved from Seattle to their Camano
Island cabin and Dirks attempted to write a novel, a lifelong dream.
After a year of eating salmon and clams with no writing sold, Clarence
and Cleo Dirks decided a change was in order. This led to the purchase
of a nearby farm and within a year a second stint as a writer with the
Seattle <em>PI</em> as described in the first <em>City Bred Farmer</em>
column.</p>
<p>The <em>City Bred Farmer</em> column lasted from May 1946 until March
1958. It began as a weekly feature. Even though it was given plenty of
space in the paper, after two years it expanded to five days a week. It
remained daily until the end of 1952 when it went to three times a week
and, after another year, returned to being a weekly feature.</p>
<p>The column provided its readers with a welcome respite from the
unsettled decades that began with the Great Depression and continued
through the Second World War. This website is dedicated to those who
might find a similar value in my dad’s writing nearly 80 years
later.</p>

Alabama in the 1926 Rose Bowl game: from left: Clarence Dirks (tackle),
Leroy Shuh (end), Herman Brix (tackle) and Elmer Huhta (guard). Dirks
became a Seattle Post-Intelligencer sportswriter and columnist. Brix was
a silver medalist in the 1928 Olympics and starred in movies and
television as Bruce Bennett. Huhta became a legendary football and
basketball coach at Hoquiam High School.</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>This is the front of a football card from a set produced
by Pacific Trading Cards, Inc. in 1992. The set of 100 cards was titled
“Washington Huskies Football Greats.” Clarence Dirks was similarly
honored in 1950 when Palo Alto High School named him their all-time
greatest athlete. Dirks won 12 varsity letters in football, basketball,
baseball and track in his three years at the school before his February
1924 midyear graduation.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Cleo Coons is shown standing to the right of the house mother
(wearing a dark dress) in the front row in this Phi Mu sorority photo
from 1930 or 1931. After just one year as a UW journalism student, she
earned a summer internship at the Seattle PI where she met her future
husband Clarence Dirks. As a sophomore she took playwriting classes and
had one of her creations staged on campus. She sold another play as part
of a school anthology.</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/introduction/media/image6.jpeg"

<p><strong>This cabin at Indian Beach on Camano Island was financed by
the sale of magazine articles by Clarence Dirks largely about the UW
Husky Crew which gained both national and international fame by winning
a gold medal in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. Cleo Dirks, Clarence’s
wife, wrote “The House the Post Built” (Writers Digest, July 1941)
detailing the trials, tribulations and ultimate successes leading up to
its construction.</strong></p>
<p>In 13½ as a <em>Seattle PI</em> sportswriter Clarence Dirks penned
over 2,000 by-lined articles. Mostly they were pieces previewing or
covering the results of a football or basketball game, a crew race, a
boxing match or some similar athletic event. The editorial below is an
exception.</p>

style="width:5.18056in;height:7.31944in" /></p>
<p>Clarence Dirks collaborated with University of Washington crew coach
Al Ulbrickson and racing shell designer and builder George Pocock for
four articles that appeared in national magazines including the
<em>Esquire</em> and <em>The Saturday Evening Post</em>. He also wrote
several fiction pieces related to collegiate crew racing including one
for the September 1936 issue of <em>College Humor</em> shown above.</p>
