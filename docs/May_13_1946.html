<p><em><strong>George Dirks, the City Bred Farmerâ€™s father, traveled up
from California to give his son a hand with his new venture. Although a
ship caulker by trade, the elder Dirks had tried his hand at dairy
faming when son Clarence was in elementary school. Although he was
unable to turn a profit, George Dirks learned a lot about the trials and
tribulations of raising cows and bringing milk to
market.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Although only 12 years old, Marty Dirks is learning a lot
about raising cows and especially milking them. Taught by his
grandfather, George Dirks, young Marty was soon adept at the task his
father was happy to let his son handle before heading off to
school.</strong></em></p>
