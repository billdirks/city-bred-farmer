<p style="margin-bottom: 0em; padding-bottom: 0em;">Clarence Dirks</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0em; padding-top: 0em;">A Man for All Seasons – A Husky to the Core</p>
</div>
<p>Dan Brown’s <em>The Boys in the Boat</em> was on the <em>New York
Times</em> bestseller list for over two years. It tells the fascinating
and now well-known story of the 1936 Olympic victory by the UW crew as
well as the personal sagas of its members. Brown’s prose is compelling,
often riveting, yet perhaps the most memorable passage from the book was
not written by the book’s author at all but rather was a line he quoted
written by a Seattle journalist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0em; padding-bottom: 0em;">“It would be useless to try to segregate outstanding members of
Washington’s varsity shell, just as it would be impossible to try to
pick a certain note in a beautifully composed song. All were merged into
one smoothly working machine; they were, in fact, a poem of motion,
symphony of swinging blades.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0em; padding-top: 0em;">Clarence Dirks, Seattle PI, 1936</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you visit the century old ASUW Shell House, you’ll find a banner
with the last part of that quote hanging from the ceiling. Perhaps
you’ll pick up a brochure celebrating the Shell House and solicitating
donations for its restoration and discover this photo of the 1936
crew:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/uw/media/image1.jpeg"
style="width:5.23819in;" /></p>
<p>Finally, if you’ve seen the excellent 2017 PBS documentary, <em>The
Boys of ’</em>36, you may recall that that same quote was cited in
describing the magic that propelled coach Al Ulbrikson’s team to an
improbable victory in a hostile environment.</p>
<p>The quote in question was penned by my father, Clarence Dirks, whose
association with the UW athletic program went far beyond his coverage of
the UW crew in 1936. In his 13 years as a <em>Seattle
Post-Intelligencer</em> sport writer, he covered the full gamut of UW
sports. Prior to that he was a full-season UW football captain as both a
freshman and a senior. He played in the Rose Bowl against Alabama (a
one-point Husky loss) and a few years later played on the first
varsity-alumni football game (won handily, 33-13, by his alumni team).
He collaborated with Al Ulbrickson and George Pocock on magazine
articles in <em>Esquire, The Saturday Evening Post,</em> and
<em>Ken</em> which brought national attention to the UW crew
program.</p>
<p>Dad also penned fiction articles drawn from his experiences with both
the UW football and crew programs which appeared in <em>Dime Sports, The
All-America Sports Magazine,</em> and <em>College Humor.</em> Dad’s
story “Poughkeepsie Pluck” (<em>Dime Sports</em>, June 1936) pivoted
around a fictionized version of Al Ulbrickson’s legendary performance
stroking the Washington varsity to victory with a torn arm muscle in
1926, the same year both Dirks and Ulbrickson were members of the Big W
club. (Photo from <em>Tyee</em> yearbook)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/uw/media/image2.jpeg"
style="width:4in;" /></p>
<p>His September 1938 article in <em>College Humor</em>, “Varsity Log,”
told a fictional tale of a girl who had a very disruptive effect on the
practice sessions of a college crew. Whether this was based on coach
Ulbrickson’s Washington varsity is unknown. In any event the original of
the illustration shown on the first page of that article has a place of
honor in my home office.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/uw/media/image3.jpeg"
style="width:5.5in;" /></p>
<p><em>Ken</em> was a short-lived, large format magazine with full page
photo spreads, similar in appearance to <em>Life</em> and <em>Look</em>
but with many more controversial and political articles. Ernest
Hemmingway was a frequent contributor. Clarence Dirks and Al Ulbrickson
collaborated on the July, 1938 piece “Cracked Oar Sweeps Hudson.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/uw/media/image4.jpeg"
style="width:4.92847in;" /></p>
<p>Besides telling the tale of Washington’s repeat victory in the 1937
Poughkeepsie Regatta despite rower Charley Day’s cracked oar, the
article also relates Ulbrickson’s unexpected lucky number in the
previous year’s Olympic Games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I thought of all the curious superstitions in rowing. I thought how
the previous season—1936—13 had been my lucky number, or must have been
because, previous to winning in Germany, our suits had been sent east in
trunk number 13. The train car was number…13. Thirteen were in our party
which embarked for Berlin. Arriving in Hamburg, we entered Germany
through warehouse gate marked number…13. The bus which took us from
Berlin to the police officers’ training school in Grunau was number…13.
At the official opening of the games my wife sat in seat number…13. The
day of the rowing finals was the first day of my 13<sup>th</sup> year of
marriage. And now there was a 13-minute delay in the all-important
race.”</p>
</blockquote>

<figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; font-style: italic;">

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Seventy-five years after the Husky’s epic victory against Italy and
Germany in Berlin another race involving Joe Rantz and his teammates was
taking place. But this time the combatants were unaware of each other,
at least at first. For at the same time that published author Daniel
James Brown was researching material for <em>The Boys in The Boat</em>,
an aspiring author, former college oarsman for Columbia and newly hired
university professor, Michael Socolow, was doing the same thing. And
Socolow struck first with an article, “Six Minutes in Berlin,” published
by the online magazine <em>Slate</em> in July, 2012. It’s an exciting
read. The article caught the attention of publishers who had initially
rejected his idea for a book on the same topic.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/uw/media/image6.jpeg"
style="width:3.72639in;" /></p>
<p>But, unfortunately for Socolow, Brown’s book was almost complete at
that point and was published to instant acclaim a year later. No
publisher would touch professor Socolow’s proposed book now.
Discouraged, but undeterred, the young academic realized he had to write
a book more attuned to the research community rather than the general
reader. The result, <em>Six Minutes in Berlin: Broadcast Spectacle and
the Nazi Olympics</em>, focused on both Ulbrickson’s crew and the events
leading up to the big race but also the history of radio, an evolving
media at that time. Personally, I find it an equally engaging read
though I’m sure it added more to the author’s advancement through
academia than to his pocketbook. And I might be just a little prejudiced
after exchanging a few emails with Mike Socolow which included the
glowing comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your father was a legend in Seattle sports history, with his
reporting and radio program, and he was up there with George Varnell and
Royal Brougham as the big names that were known nationally for their
work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, Royal Brougham, my dad’s boss and mentor during his tenure
at the <em>Seattle PI</em>, is a Seattle print and broadcasting legend.
Varnell was an accomplished sports writer for the <em>Seattle Times</em>
as well as longtime football referee. In fact, while my dad played
tackle for the Washington side in that famous 1926 UW versus Alabama
game, Varnell was on the field as an official. Varnell had also been a
football star during his college days playing under Amos Alonzo Stagg at
Chicago and later at Kentucky. And, amazingly, before joining the
<em>Seattle</em> Times sports staff, Varnell was for a short time the
head coach of the then Gonzaga College basketball <u>and</u> football
teams while working for a Spokane daily paper. While covering the UW
crew team, both my dad and George Varnell rowed under Ulbrickson to get
a “feel” for crew. Whether they ever got into a shell together, or
competed informally, is unknown.</p>
<p>Clarence Dirks was born in 1903 in Oakland, California, the first of
five children. The family later moved to Palo Alto and subsequently to
the Butchertown neighborhood of San Francisco. As a boy, he helped his
father deliver ice up and down the city’s hills in a horse-drawn cart
before heading off to school. Clarence’s great-grandfather, John Johnson
Dirks, arrived in San Francisco around 1850 from Holland. He was the
shipwright on a German sailing ship that probably took five or six
months to make the journey around Cape Horn.</p>
<p>By 1868 John J. Dirks had established the first shipyard in the India
Basin neighborhood of the city where he and his sons built scow
schooners which hauled hay, grain, salt and other commodities from
otherwise inaccessible places upriver. Today, a new waterfront park is
being created from the Dirks’ boatyard. The cottage the family built in
1875 (San Francisco Landmark #250) is being transformed into a visitor
center.</p>
<p>From 1921 to 1924 Clarence attended Palo Alto high school (Paly)
where he won 12 varsity letters and was selected by his former coach as
the greatest athlete ever to attend the school a quarter century
later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Clarence Dirks, star tackle and captain of the Palo Alto High School
football team of 1923, was today voted the greatest athlete to ever
compete for the local school. Dirks led a lengthy list of candidates in
the selection made by Howard “Hod” Ray veteran Palo Alto athletic
director and coach…The veteran coach in naming Dirks recalled that his
former tackle was a big, rough 200 pounder who was head and shoulders
over any lineman in the league in his days. He has also a star performer
in basketball, baseball and a standout javelin man on the track
team.”</p>
<p>(<em>Palo Alto Times</em>, April 5, 1950)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what exactly made Clarence Dirks such an outstanding athlete at
Paly and later at the University of Washington? What preparation had
allowed him to excel to the extent that he did? There were no training
rooms, exercise equipment or specialized strength coaches in those days.
The answer has to do with the outbreak of World War I in 1914 in Europe.
Almost immediately the ailing US ship building industry started to
revive. Clarence’s father George O. Dirks was finally able to return to
the trade he had apprenticed in a decade earlier. George no longer had
to deliver ice, try to eke out a living as a dairy farmer or take
tickets at a Nickelodeon as he was currently doing. The elder Dirks had
been offered a ship caulking job in Washington State and the family soon
moved there. Clarence finished eighth grade in 1917 in Aberdeen just
after the US entered the war. He decided to interrupt his education and
apprentice at the Seaborn Shipyards in Tacoma where his father had
become boss caulker. It was serving his 18-month apprenticeship there
and later on the Seattle waterfront and back home in San Francisco that
Dirks not only gained muscle and the sharp eyesight needed to avoid
industrial accidents, but also learned much about the art of leadership
and an ability to get along with the diverse set of backgrounds and
personalities found among his shipyard workmates. What he learned in his
three-year break from formal schooling would serve him well for the rest
of his life.</p>

</figure>
<p>Clarence Dirks spent three years as a ship caulker, filling seams in
wooden boats to make them watertight, before starting high school in
Palo Alto near Stanford University. At Paly he was active in journalism
and graduated as president of his small half-year class of 25 in
February, 1924. He enrolled in the University of Washington that fall, not because of
its excellent football program under coach Enoch Bagshaw, but rather
because a Paly coach’s wife, a UW alum, had told him that the University
of Washington had the finest journalism school on the West Coast. Once
on campus, he joined the Theta Beta Pi fraternity and settled into
college life.</p>
<p>Dirks did turn out for the freshman football team that fall. He
played tackle and captained the squad. In the spring he joined the
freshman baseball team as a catcher.</p>

</figure>
<p>The following fall Clarence Dirks earned a spot on the 1925 varsity
football team, one of the most renowned UW teams of all time. And one of
greatest players to ever wear a Husky uniform and Washington’s first
consensus All-American, George Wilson, was a teammate. The Huskies
finished the regular season 10-0-1, the only blemish on their record a
6-6 tie against a formidable Nebraska eleven. The UW team had outscored
their opponents 480-39 and were headed to the Rose Bowl for the second
time in three seasons. After several teams refused an invitation to play
Washington in Pasadena, the University of Alabama accepted. The Crimson
Tide’s season had been equally impressive, perhaps even more so. With a
record of 9-0, they outscored their opponents 277-7. They were only
scored on once all season, that in a 50-7 victory. Much has been written
about the 1926 Rose Bowl in which Alabama prevailed 20-19 over Coach
Bagshaw’s team. There was no officially recognized national football
champion at that time. The Associated Press did not poll college coaches
and crown champions until 1934. But Alabama, using various credible
metrics has determined that the Crimson Tide and undefeated Dartmouth
should be considered the 1925 co-champions. Furthermore, Alabama Public
Television produced a fascinating documentary on the 1925 Alabama squad
and their trip to the Rose Bowl. “Roses of Crimson” can be viewed on
YouTube.</p>

Hoquiam High School.</p></figcaption></figure>

</figure>
<p>Reluctantly, when the school year ended Dirks decided he needed to
take a year off from his education to replenish his financial coffers. A
ship building boom of sorts was taking place in New Jersey and my dad
headed there for a year’s work as a ship caulker.</p>
<p>Back in Seattle, he re-enrolled at the UW with a healthier bank
account and muscles well-conditioned after a year of hard labor in an
East Coast shipyard. And he had his best year yet as a member of Enoch
Bagshaw’s pigskin brigade. The team recorded a 9-2 record and Dirks was
outstanding. While playing the final game of the season against USC in
Los Angeles, he received a telegram from his fraternity brothers back in
Seattle congratulating him on being chosen to captain the 1928 team.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/uw/media/image12.jpeg"
style="width:3.82996in;" />
<figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; font-style: italic;"><p>Clarence Dirks wore jersey number 28 in his three years on the UW
football varsity: 1925 (reserve), 1927 (star), 1928 (captain). He
skipped the 1926 season to work on a New Jersey waterfront. A
fifth-generation ship caulker, he was the first in his family to attend
college, probably the first to attend high school.</p></figcaption>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/uw/media/image13.jpeg"
style="width:5.34514in;" /></p>
<p>And Clarence Dirks received some national attention for his
outstanding efforts as a tackle for Washington. <em>The American
Golfer</em> magazine included him among 14 players it deemed players to
watch, “Gridiron Warriors Who Lead,” as they put it. Aspiring
All-Americans, 7 of the 14 did gain that elevated status at the end of
the 1928 season. But Clarence Dirks was not among them.</p>

<figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; font-style: italic;"><p>Clarence Dirks was among 14 college football standouts and team
leaders The American Golfer said to watch in its October 1928 issue.
Half of the 14 made All-American status at the end of the season.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Unfortunately, 1928 was less than a banner year for the Huskies who
ended with a 7-4 record, most of its wins coming against non-conference
foes. Dirks himself suffered a broken bone in his leg at the start of
the eighth game and only returned briefly in a 6-0 defeat of Washington
State at the end of the season. Outstanding play from the UW’s second
consensus All-American, Chuck Carroll (later a long-time King County
Prosecutor), was the season’s bright spot. Coincidentally, Carroll, like
Dirks in Palo Alto, was chosen by Seattle’s Garfield High School in 1950
as the school’s greatest all-time athlete.</p>

<p>While his football career ended that year, another career had just
begun. Royal Brougham, then managing editor of the <em>Seattle
Post-Intelligencer</em> newspaper, had hired Dirks as a student
correspondent at the start of the football season and offered him a
fulltime position at season’s end. With just one course to complete for
his degree, my dad began his career as a by-lined sportswriter at the
<em>PI</em> in February, 1929. His first articles included a photo of
him in his leather football helmet.</p>

by a score of 13-12.</p></figcaption>

</figure>
<p>Clarence Dirks continued his <em>Seattle PI</em> career into the
1930s. By 1935 he was an established voice of the Seattle athletic
scene. And like most sportswriters, he could be a bit of a cheerleader,
especially where his beloved Huskies were concerned. But one thing was
beginning to bother him: the lack of Black faces on UW teams. UCLA had
them; Washington did not. Covering high school football championship
games, Dirks had become well aware of the talent coming out of Seattle’s
Garfield High School. And many of the school’s best players were Black.
Why had Brennan King, he wondered, a multi-sport Garfield star,
completed his college education at North Carolina A&amp;T rather than
the closer-to-home UW? Frustrated, Dirks did what little he could to
remedy the situation. In 1968 Larry Gossett, later a longtime King
County councilman, recorded an interview with a contemporary of Brenan
King and summarized: “Charles Russell attended Garfield High School and
UW, where he was noted as a star football player. He left the UW because
of discrimination on the part of his coach, James Phelan and other team
members. He was only allowed on the football team
because of pressure, largely on the part of Clarence Dirks, a
Seattle Post Intelligencer sportswriter. Russell left Seattle
after 2 years at the UW…” At least Russell did earn a football letter
before his departure. Clarence Dirks continued covering his local sports
beat. It would take the Huskies two more decades before they achieved
something closer to racial equity on the playing field.</p>
<p>The year 1936 proved a pivotal one for both Clarence Dirks and for Al
Ulbrickson and his Husky oarsmen. While Coach Ulbrickson was preparing
his crew for their final US races and money was being for their trip to
Berlin, Dirks was preparing for a newspaper strike. He knew it would
happen. As he told me 40 years later, “Every time Hearst got another
load of marble from Italy for that damn castle of his, our pay packets
got a little bit slimmer.” And you’ll recall, I’m sure,” from reading
<em>The Boys in The Boat</em>, that just as the Husky Crew beat its
opponents in dramatic fashion in Berlin, the <em>PI</em>’s reporters and
staff did go on strike. The last straw was the firing of two senior
staffers for joining The Newspaper Guild. Royal Brougham, in Germany
with the UW team, was unable to file a story that would have been one of
the most unforgettable he ever wrote.</p>
<p>Several months before the strike began, Clarence Dirks secured a
second source of income, meager as it was. Sponsored by a Seattle
clothier, he began a weekly sports program on KOMO radio. While mainly
covering UW athletics, his most memorable broadcast occurred at a boxing
match. Freddie Steele, known as the “Tacoma Assassin,” was defending his
world middleweight title against challenger Eddie “Babe” Risko in
Seattle’s Civic Stadium on July 11th. As a gimmick Dirks convinced the
fight’s organizers to let him box a round with the champ and another
with the challenger as a warmup before the main event. Dirks then told
his radio audience what it felt like to get knocked to the mat by each
competitor. He never received more mail after a single broadcast. And
the event gave him a trifecta of sorts. Besides his radio coverage of
the fight and his newspaper story the next morning, he wrote an article
that appeared later in a national boxing magazine (“Fists of Steele,”
<em>Ring Magazine,</em> November 1936).</p>
<p>The <em>PI</em> strike would last over three months. Clarence Dirks
was feeling the pressure for extra income He not only had a wife and
two-year-old child (Marty, UW’60) to feed, he and his wife had recently
purchased an old Indian Beach cabin and lot where they had honeymooned
from the elderly owners who had closed their resort. Payments had to be
made and Dirks was determined to sell more magazine articles. The recent
<em>College Humor</em> article “Varsity Log” had brought in $150 and the
<em>Esquire</em> collaboration with Al Ulbrickson, “Row, Damit, Row”
about the same. “Poughkeepsie Pluck,” in <em>Dime Sports</em> had paid
less. Both “Varsity Log” and “Sweeping the Hudson,” another
collaboration with Ulbrickson, had earlier been submitted to <em>The
Saturday Evening Post</em> and summarily rejected. But Dirks was certain
he could make a sale to that more prestigious publication.
(<em>Esquire</em> was still a fledgling magazine at that point.)</p>
<p>Four weeks after Roosevelt beat Landon in the 1936 Presidential race,
the Hearst Corporation settled with its workers at the <em>Seattle
PI</em> giving Clarence Dirks a $10 a week raise and a five-day work
week instead of six. And then a few days later a telegram arrived from
the <em>Saturday Evening Post.</em> The article “Rockne of Rowing” based
on interviews Dirks had conducted with Al Ulbrickson after his return
from Germany had been accepted and a check for $500 was on the way. At
last, a sale to the <em>Post</em>! The $300 balance owed on the somewhat
dingy Camano Island cabin and waterfront lot could now be paid off in
full. Some of the building materials for a more spacious vacation home
could be purchased.</p>

resulted in the Husky victory in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The photo

Huskies on Lake Union.” Note the Alaska cannery ships in the background.

<p>Dirks now went to work in earnest writing magazine articles in his
spare time. With increased confidence, he spent several evenings
interviewing George Pocock, scholarly, internationally known builder of
racing shells. The result, “One Man Navy Yard,” was sent to the
<em>Post</em>. Eventually, a reply was received. The editors wanted to
use the article but revisions would be needed. Another interview with
Pocock took place, the article was re-submitted and shortly thereafter
accepted with the promise of another $500 check on the way.</p>

House.</p></figcaption>

<p>A final sale to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> gave the Dirks
family all they needed to complete their second home on Camano Island.
Clarence Dirks loved to fish at Camano and he approached the
<em>Post</em> about using an annual Seattle fishing derby as the focus
for an article. The editors were only lukewarm about the idea but noted
Dirks’ enthusiasm for the project and told him to submit the completed
article for possible consideration. A more positive response was hoped
for, but Dirks finally completed “Salmon Derby” and sent it in. To his
surprise, it was accepted immediately.</p>

Saturday Evening Post article</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finances in hand, Clarence Dirks, his father-in-law and several
Indian Beach neighbors could now complete the cabin that resulted from
the proceeds of half a dozen magazine articles most of which related to
the University of Washington’s crew, its coach and the builder of its
renowned racing shells.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/uw/media/image25.jpeg"

<figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; font-style: italic;"><p>This cabin at Indian Beach on Camano Island was financed by the sale
of magazine articles by Clarence Dirks largely about the UW Husky Crew.
Cleo Dirks, Clarence’s wife, wrote “The House the Post Built” (Writers
Digest, July 1941) detailing the trials, tribulations and ultimate
successes leading up to its construction. The article could have just as
easily been titled “The House the Boys in The Boat Built..”</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Clarence Dirks could now focus on his job at the <em>Seattle PI</em>,
his family and fishing at Camano Island. But World War II soon
intervened. The need for skilled workers at Seattle shipyards was evident 
and in May 1942 Dirks became a fulltime caulker on the Seattle waterfront 
after his workday writing sports
stories ended. After six months he was exhausted. His last sports byline
appeared in the November 2, 1942 edition of the <em>PI</em> with a story
about an upcoming, crucial football game pitting his alma mater against
UCLA.</p>
<p>But his career as a newspaper writer was far from over. At the
conclusion of the war the Dirks family decided to sell their Seattle
home and relocate to Camano Island. After a year in their cabin during
which Clarence Dirks was unsuccessful at writing his version of the
Great American Novel, they bought a small farm nearby and attempted to
make a go of growing apples and holly, raising cows and chickens and
keeping bees. I was born soon after the move. Visiting former colleagues
from the <em>PI</em> later convinced my dad that he could make more
money writing about his rural adventure than he would ever make from the
farm itself. Thus, his column “The City-Bred Farmer on Puget Sound” was
born. Within two years it went from one day a week to five. A morning
radio broadcast on Seattle’s KOMO soon followed. Mention in one column
that neighbors were in need of a church to replace an aging camp
building they were using resulted in a campaign that funded its
construction. And Clarence Dirks was becoming in demand as a speaker.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the pressure caused by all these activities took a
toll on the Dirks marriage which ended in 1952. A little over a year
later my dad remarried. The column continued another six years.</p>
<p>After his <em>Seattle PI</em> job ended Clarence Dirks tried several
other means of earning a living. He had become the lay pastor at Camano
Chapel, the church funded by his column’s readers, and continued in that
role for a decade. He wrote articles for a commercial fishing newspaper
and worked for a time at the <em>Anacortes American.</em> He even tried
his luck as a commercial fisherman. He ran unsuccessfully for the US
Congress. Eventually he returned to the trade he learned decades
earlier; he became a ship caulker again. But this did not keep him from
writing. His last two articles to appear in the <em>PI</em> were about
ship caulking. His August 15, 1965 piece was titled “When a Luxembourg
Cook Tamed The ‘7 Wild Men’ of St. Michael: An Alaskan Adventure at the
Mouth of the Yukon.”</p>

<p>After his death in 1985 my dad received some of the recognition he
richly deserved both as an athlete and as a newspaper writer. In 1992 he
was included in a UW authorized set of sports cards ‘Washington Huskies
Football Greats;” one of 100 players selected.</p>

<p>And in 2001 the church he had helped found held a 50<sup>th</sup>
anniversary celebration. Camano Chapel had, by then, grown from a small
congregation into a mega-church, the largest on Camano. As part of its
celebration, it held a Clarence Dirks night. One parishioner played the
part of my dad and read a dozen or so of his “City Bred Farmer” columns.
One of these has always been a favorite of mine and I’ll conclude my 
tribute to my dad, always a proud UW alum, with it.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0em; padding-bottom: 0em;"><strong>Farmer, Petunia in Football Match</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0em; padding-top: 0em;"><strong>(<em>Seattle Post-Intelligencer,</em> July 7,
1948)</strong></p></span>
<blockquote>
<p>Ordinarily, in the early morning after milking, these lines are
written before Cleo and Marty and little Michael are awake….</p>
<p>This morning, as the farmer sat down, he glanced outside, trying to
snare a random thought.</p>
<p>Omigosh! Petunia, the pig, had gotten out of her stall! Petunia was
in deep grass near the garage doors. She was eyeing the gate!</p>
<p>“Petunia?” asked Grandpa George as he waited for the milk to cool so
it could be taken to the stand by the road. “Oh, the pig!”</p>
<p>The instant Petunia saw two lumbering 200 pounders bearing down on
her, she emitted a startled grunt. She turned and took off in tall grass
toward the calves’ pen.</p>
<p>“Remember the time Big Bill, the ram, broke loose and you had to
tackle him in a patch of thistles,” warned Grandpa George. “If Petunia
ever gets in the alley, you’ll never see her again.”</p>
<p>The Farmer chased Petunia like a bulky tackle going downfield under a
punt.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was like the old football days all over again when Petunia
reached the fence, whirled and faced the Farmer.</p>
<p>Petunia was like a half-pint ball carrier. She very well could have
been little WSC star Butch Meeker, who used to stand, catch a punt, then
watch the Farmer, among others, bear down on him.</p>
<p>Suddenly Butch would give his hips a little shake. The Farmer would
go one way. Butch would go the other.</p>
<p>That’s precisely what happened now. Petunia flapped her ears to the
left, squealed. As the Farmer dove, Petunia zigged to the right.</p>
<p>Sprawling on his stomach, the Farmer found nothing in his grasp
except grass.</p>
<p>“Okay,” yelled Grandpa George, disgusted. “You missed her. She’s in
the barn now. Go round to the side entrance so she can’t get out that
way. I’ll go in this door. We’ll have her trapped between us.”</p>
<p>A long cement floor alley cuts through the barn. Stalls are on the
left. Baled hay is stacked against the wall. In between is the
alley.</p>
<p>The Farmer found Petunia perplexed in the alley as both exits were
blocked. The big problem was now to try to catch her.</p>
<p>Grandpa George held a finger to his lips for silence. He bent down
low, trying to slip up behind her from the back side of a bale of
hay.</p>
<p>When Petunia eyed him, Grandpa George slipped to his hands and knees
and commenced to crawl as little Michael used to do.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Grandpa George made a lunge. He missed her by inches.</p>
<p>Petunia started toward the Farmer, found her way blocked, turned and,
with hard feet scratching the cement floor, commenced ear flapping
around in a circle.</p>
<p>“I’ve got her!” cried the Farmer.</p>
<p>He thought he did. But Petunia’s fat little white-haired body
squeezed through his hands. She ran between his legs, reversed her
field, and dashed right into Grandpa George’s arms.</p>
<p>All Grandpa George had to do was grab and hold her by the hind
legs.</p>
<p>How Petunia squealed!</p>
<p>After Petunia was back in her stall, Grandpa George said: “Now fix
the door this time so she can’t get out.”</p>
<p>A wooden door soon replaced the two bales of hay….</p>
<p>Eggs collected 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clarence Dirks, a Husky to the core, could never forget his time on
the UW gridiron.</p>
<p></br></p>
<p>The author, Mike Dirks, is himself a proud UW alum (UW’68). Not an
athlete like his dad, he does remember when, early in his freshman year,
a member of the Husky Crew coaching staff stopped him outside the
student union and suggested that he might want to try out for the team
and offered him two-week trial period, room and board included.
Flattered, but certain of the outcome, he turned him down. Mike Dirks
got a degree in math and had a 47-year career as a high school and
community college teacher.</p>
